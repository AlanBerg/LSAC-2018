=====================================  

### Risk
 
We can not suppose teachers to find their own uses and adapt the interface based on their ways of working and goals they persue, but there will be teachers willing to experiment. For instance when teachers want to relate significant events to each other (from different data sources or different actors), how much work will that be, can they find support?
 
### Mitigation
 
1. There should be enough use cases worked out for those teachers who are not willing to experiment and fit the tools into their own ways of working
2. Provide teachers willing to experiment a way to talk to developers with their questions and concerns
3. Provide inspirational demonstrations

### Relates to

not enough knowledge about what is already possible
