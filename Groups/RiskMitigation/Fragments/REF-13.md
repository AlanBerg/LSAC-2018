=====================================  

### Risk

If we do not share our algorithms and training data then we cannot evaluate their relative quality. This fact may playout when we want to choose between commercial products.


### Mitigation

1. Agree on a trusted third party to compare algorithms
2. Whne created by the public sector Share Algorithms in a PMML format with contextual information and if possible training data.
3. Design and enact benchmarks
