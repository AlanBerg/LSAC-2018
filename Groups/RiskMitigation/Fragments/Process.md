===================================== 

### The Process

Saying something about where we got in this Amsterdam 2018 hackaton and how it can be pushed forward next time

We set up first visualisation of risk categories and risks (and subrisks to those). 
Described the risks further and formulated mitigation possibilities with some references

Have not managed a solution for click through from risks to related mitigations in the visualisation.

Next time - 

Make sure to include risks formulated by different staeholders with experience in this field
Collecting more risks, interrelating them, maybe specify different audiences for the visualisation. 
Exploring the 'wording'/ glossary (e.g. as entry points for an associated search tool when it gets too information dense?)
put in the associated mitigations with attached resources like references to work done (as much as possible adding them as open source files, e.g. if the academic articles are available online)
