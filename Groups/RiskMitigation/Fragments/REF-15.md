=====================================  

### Risk
 
Validity of the measurements presented on a dashboard will (or will not) be questioned both by teachers and students using a dashboard as by researchers studying how a dashboard works. Are we measuring what we mean to be measuring? "measures of learning need to be accurate, fair, reliable, valid, and interpretable regardless of whether they are used for prediction, for feedback, or for research (Berger et al. 2017; Milligan, 2015; Prinsloo & Slade, 2017; Ringtved, Milligan, Corrin & Law, 2017)". "Questions are being raised about the effectiveness of analytics (Ferguson & Clow,2017)."

**Related:** developers have too little knowledge (theory) about learning sciences (e.g. "mere quantification is not measurement, unless the numbers allocated to people actually reflect educationally meaningful differences related to learning (capabilities) along a plausible developmental continuum. 
 
### Mitigation
 
1. Teachers and students should somehow be made to feel that they are part of the conversation about what is measured and why.
2. Provide as clear as possible of an explanation to the different users of what is measured and what it indicates (if not a direct measure).
3. Sort the explanations according to central didactical pedagogical ideas, such as in which phase of learning this measure is more or less important (e.g. beginning or mature learners; In any domain, there tend to be typical patterns or trajectories of development in performance, or growth), within what type of learning activity (in what social constellation),
4. It helps interpretation if the scale and scope of learning outcomes in the domain are clearly outlined.
