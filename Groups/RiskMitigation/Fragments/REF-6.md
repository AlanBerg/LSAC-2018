<span style="background-color:RED;">**REF-6</span>Data Silo's**{data-navmenu="To Sort"}
=====================================  

### Risk

SIS sits in one silo. LMS data in another and other systems sit in other parts of your organisation. Because of the Silo's you cannot aggregate your data.

### Mitigation

1. Time for a datawarehouse project
2. Standarisation of Student Digital traces
3. Sometimes you need good old fashioned top down leadership
4. Training of data stewards
