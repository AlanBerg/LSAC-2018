=====================================  

### Risk

You build a service or a dashboard and do not involve the user. The service is not popular because there are issues that you have not thought about or extra requirements that you have missed.

### Mitigation

1. Review stakeholder involvement before the beginning of a project.
2. Plan time and resources for student or teacher participation.
