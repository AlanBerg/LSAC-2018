abstract = {Within the evolution of technology in education, Learning Analytics has reserved its position as a robust technological field that promises to empower instructors and learners in different educational fields. The 2014 horizon report (Johnson et al., 2014), expects it to be adopted by educational institutions in the near future. However, the processes and phases as well as constraints are still not deeply debated. In this research study, the authors talk about the essence, objectives and methodologies of Learning Analytics and propose a first prototype life cycle that describes its entire process. Furthermore, the authors raise substantial questions related to challenges such as security, policy and ethics issues that limit the beneficial appliances of Learning Analytics processes.},

@article{Wise2014,
abstract = {This article addresses a relatively unexplored area in the emerging field of learning analytics, the design of learning analytics interventions. A learning analytics intervention is defined as the surrounding frame of activity through which analytic tools, data, and reports are taken up and used. It is a soft technology that involves the orchestration of the human process of engaging with the analytics as part of the larger teaching and learning activity. This paper first makes the case for the overall importance of intervention design, situating it within the larger landscape of the learning analytics field, and then considers the specific issues of intervention design for student use of learning analytics. Four principles of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design that can be used by teachers and course developers to support the productive use of learning analytics by students are introduced: Integration, Agency, Reference Frame and Dialogue. In addition three core processes in which to engage students are described: Grounding, Goal-Setting and Reflection. These principles and processes are united in a preliminary model of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design for students, presented as a starting point for further inquiry.

@article{Serrano-Laguna2017,
abstract = {Learning Analytics is an emerging field focused on analyzing learners' interactions with educational content. One of the key open issues in learning analytics is the standardization of the data collected. This is a particularly challenging issue in serious games, which generate a diverse range of data. This paper reviews the current state of learning analytics, data standards and serious games, studying how serious games are tracking the interactions from their players and the metrics that can be distilled from them. Based on this review, we propose an interaction model that establishes a basis for applying Learning Analytics into serious games. This paper then analyzes the current standards and specifications used in the field. Finally, it presents an implementation of the model with one of the most promising specifications: Experience API (xAPI). The Experience API relies on Communities of Practice developing profiles that cover different use cases in specific domains. This paper presents the Serious Games xAPI Profile: a profile developed to align with the most common use cases in the serious games domain. The profile is applied to a case study (a demo game), which explores the technical practicalities of standardizing data acquisition in serious games. In summary, the paper presents a new interaction model to track serious games and their implementation with the xAPI specification.},

@article{Rubel2016,
abstract = {In recent years, educational institutions have started using the tools of commercial data analytics in higher education. By gathering information about students as they navigate campus information systems, learning analytics “uses analytic techniques to help target instructional, curricular, and support resources” to examine student learning behaviors and change students' learning environments. As a result, the information educators and educational institutions have at their disposal is no longer demarcated by course content and assessments, and old boundaries between information used for assessment and information about how students live and work are blurring. Our goal in this paper is to provide a systematic discussion of the ways in which privacy and learning analytics conflict and to provide a framework for understanding those conflicts. We argue that there are five crucial issues about student privacy that we must address in order to ensure that whatever the laudable goals and gains of learning analytics, they are commensurate with respecting students' privacy and associated rights, including (but not limited to) autonomy interests. First, we argue that we must distinguish among different entities with respect to whom students have, or lack, privacy. Second, we argue that we need clear criteria for what information may justifiably be collected in the name of learning analytics. Third, we need to address whether purported consequences of learning analytics (e.g., better learning outcomes) are justified and what the distributions of those consequences are. Fourth, we argue that regardless of how robust the benefits of learning analytics turn out to be, students have important autonomy interests in how information about them is collected. Finally, we argue that it is an open question whether the goods that justify higher education are advanced by learning analytics, or whether collection of information actually runs counter to those goods.},

@article{Avella2016,
abstract = {Higher education for the 21st century continues to promote discoveries in the field through learning analytics (LA). The problem is that the rapid embrace of of LA diverts educators' attention from clearly identifying requirements and implications of using LA in higher education. LA is a promising emerging field, yet higher education stakeholders need to become further familiar with issues related to the use of LA in higher education. Few studies have synthesized previous studies to provide an overview of LA issues in higher education. To address the problem, a systemic literature review was conducted to provide an overview of methods, benefits, and challenges of using LA in higher education. The literature review revealed that LA uses various methods including visual data analysis techniques, social network analysis, semantic, and educational data mining including prediction, clustering, relationship mining, discovery with models, and separation of data for human judgment to analyze data. The benefits include targeted course offerings, curriculum development, student learning outcomes, behavior and process, personalized learning, improved instructor performance, post-educational employment opportunities, and enhanced research in the field of education. Challenges include issues related to data tracking, collection, evaluation, analysis; lack of connection to learning sciences; optimizing learning environments, and ethical and privacy issues. Such a comprehensive overview provides an integrative report for faculty, course developers, and administrators about methods, benefits, and challenges of LA so that they may apply LA more effectively to improve teaching and learning in higher education.},

@article{Slade2013,
abstract = {The field of learning analytics has the potential to enable higher education institutions to increase their understanding of their students' learning needs and to use that understanding to positively influence student learning and progression. Analysis of data relating to students and their engagement with their learning is the foundation of this process. There is an inherent assumption linked to learning analytics that knowledge of a learner's behavior is advantageous for the individual, instructor, and educational provider. It seems intuitively obvious that a greater understanding of a student cohort and the learning designs and interventions they best respond to would benefit students and, in turn, the institution's retention and success rate. Yet collection of data and their use face a number of ethical challenges, including location and interpretation of data; informed consent, privacy, and deidentification of data; and classification and management of data. Approaches taken to understand the opportunities and ethical challenges of learning analytics necessarily depend on many ideological assumptions and epistemologies. This article proposes a sociocritical perspective on the use of learning analytics. Such an approach highlights the role of power, the impact of surveillance, the need for transparency, and an acknowledgment that student identity is a transient, temporal, and context-bound construct. Each of these affects the scope and definition of learning analytics' ethical use. We propose six principles as a framework for considerations to guide higher education institutions to address ethical issues in learning analytics and challenges in context-dependent and appropriate ways.},

Therefore, this research investigates learners' satisfaction, behavioral intentions, and the effectiveness of the Blackboard e-learning system. A total of 424 university students were surveyed using a standard questionnaire. The results showed that perceived self-efficacy is a critical factor that influences learners' satisfaction with the Blackboard e-learning system. Perceived usefulness and perceived satisfaction both contribute to the learners' behavioral intention to use the e-learning system. Furthermore, e-learning effectiveness can be influenced by multimedia instruction, interactive learning activities, and e-learning system quality.

abstract = {The opportunity to facilitate cancer courses for Queensland Health staff on a Learning Management System (LMS) was seized by Central Integrated Regional Cancer Service (CIRCS) for a blended-learning approach to the provision of clinical education. CIRCS provides this approach through Teleeducation and Brightspace by D2L LMS. CIRCS currently facilitates five online and blended-learning courses on the Brightspace LMS. These courses are delivered to Queensland Health's clinical streams across sixteen Hospital and Health Services (HHSs) and 1,722,000 square kilometres of land. In rural, regional and remote areas of the state the challenge of providing access to this clinical education is diminished through the use of this LMS and Tele-education. The Handing antineoplastic drugs and related waste safely and Administration of oral antineoplastic drugs modules enable HHSs to comply with acts, regulations, standards, and codes of practice. Instilling the value of completing ADAC in the nursing stream has been paramount to its success in improving Queensland Health's service delivery. The approach to this included marketing the courses as: • Self-paced • Interactive • Relevant and directly applicable to their workplace • Results-oriented Learners are able to view: • Grades • Certificates • Learning activities • Resources Where facilitators are unavailable to conduct a supervised clinical practice and competency assessment or a clinical skills workshop the learner can attend via a Tele-education session run by CIRCS's Nurse Educator. All attendee and facilitator data is captured through registrations and evaluations. Tele-education allows for: • Simulated face-to-face interaction • Questions and clarification • Direct sharing of presentations and resources • Real-time assessments and progress records.},

abstract = {The Learning Analytics (LA) discipline analyzes educational data obtained from student interaction with online resources. Most of the data is collected from Learning Management Systems deployed at established educational institutions. In addition, other learning platforms, most notably Massive Open Online Courses such as Udacity and Coursera or other educational initiatives such as Khan Academy, generate large amounts of data. However, there is no generally agreed-upon data model for student interactions. Thus, analysis tools must be tailored to each system's particular data structure, reducing their interoperability and increasing development costs. Some e-Learning standards designed for content interoperability include data models for gathering student performance information. In this paper, we describe how well-known LA tools collect data, which we link to how two e-Learning standards - IEEE Standard for Learning Technology and Experience API - define their data models. From this analysis, we identify the advantages of using these e-Learning standards from the point of view of Learning Analytics.},

@article{Vieira2018,
abstract = {We present a systematic literature review of the emerging field of visual learning analytics. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze existing approaches, audiences, purposes, contexts, and data sources—both individually and in relation to one another—that designers and researchers have used to visualize educational data. Second, we examine how established literature in the fields of information visualization and education has been used to inform the design of visual learning analytics tools and to discuss research findings. We characterize the reviewed literature based on three dimensions: (a) connection with visualization background; (b) connection with educational theory; and (c) sophistication of visualization(s). The results from this systematic review suggest that: (1) little work has been done to bring visual learning analytics tools into classroom settings; (2) few studies consider background information from the students, such as demographics or prior performance; (3) traditional statistical visualization techniques, such as bar plots and scatter plots, are still the most commonly used in learning analytics contexts, while more advanced or novel techniques are rarely used; (4) while some studies employ sophisticated visualizations, and some engage deeply with educational theories, there is a lack of studies that both employ sophisticated visualizations and engage deeply with educational theories. Finally, we present a brief research agenda for the field of visual learning analytics based on the findings of our literature review.},

@article{Macfadyen2012,
abstract = {Learning analytics offers higher education valuable insights that can inform strategic decision-making regarding resource allocation for educational excellence. Research demonstrates that learning management systems (LMSs) can increase student sense of community, support learning communities and enhance student engagement and success, and LMSs have therefore become core enterprise component in many universities. We were invited to undertake a current state analysis of enterprise LMS use in a large research-intensive university, to provide data to inform and guide an LMS review and strategic planning process. Using a new e-learning analytics platform, combined with data visualization and participant observation, we prepared a detailed snapshot of current LMS use patterns and trends and their relationship to student learning outcomes. This paper presents selected data from this "current state analysis" and comments on what it reveals about the comparative effectiveness of this institution's LMS integration in the service of learning and teaching. More critically, it discusses the reality that the institutional planning process was nonetheless dominated by technical concerns, and made little use of the intelligence revealed by the analytics process. To explain this phenomenon we consider theories of change management and resistance to innovation, and argue that to have meaningful impact, learning analytics proponents must also delve into the socio-technical sphere to ensure that learning analytics data are presented to those involved in strategic institutional planning in ways that have the power to motivate organizational adoption and cultural change.

abstract = {Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the experience and involvement of academics in learning analytics (LA) due to its potential for improving teaching and learning. However, findings often reflect an educational culture which is indicative of the institutional or national context where the study has occurred, resulting in bias regarding LA perspectives. Therefore, this study seeks to compare and contrast the experiences of LA among academics in Australia and Malaysia, with intentions to learn from each other's experience. Areas of comparison were: (1) academics' involvement in LA activities; (2) academics' responses to the institutional capacity in supporting LA; and 3) academics' concerns about the ethical issues surrounding LA. A survey of 353 Australian and 224 Malaysian academics revealed similarities and differences. It is evident from these results that the context and infrastructure for LA are at different stages of development in both countries. Nevertheless, the results provide an interesting reflection on academics' needs, institutional understanding, policies, and educational cultural biases in applying LA in teaching and learning in higher education institutions.},

abstract = {The collapse of InBloom marks a backlash against the personalized learning industry. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nA year ago, every public school student in New York State fell under the watchful eye of InBloom, a data analytics company. Schools sent the company an enormous batch of data spanning 400-odd fields that included a wide range of personal details, from test scores and special-education enrollment to whether kids got free lunches. The idea was to compile enough information so teachers or software could tailor assignments to each student's needs. InBloom had contracts to do the same for millions of public school kids across nine states, tracking their work to draw conclusions about their academic performance. InBloom promised to analyze its data and make the results accessible to teachers and parents. That made InBloom the hottest company in the emerging field of personalized learning, pitched as a way to help overcrowded, underfunded schools to better teach each student. That was until April 21, when InBloom abruptly announced it soon planned to shut down.},

abstract = {As in many fields, most papers in the learning analytics literature report success or, at least, read as if they are reporting success. This is almost certainly not because learning analytics research and activity are always successful. Generally, we report our successes widely, but keep our failures to ourselves. As Bismarck is alleged to have said: it is wise to learn from the mistakes of others. This workshop offers an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to share their failures in a lower-stakes environment, to help them learn from each other's mistakes.},

abstract = {The promise of learning analytics is that they will use educational data to improve the quality and value of the learning experience within our schools and universities.1 These promised gains come at a cost. Investment in data collection and storage, development of context-sensitive algorithms, and staff development are all important, but they do not guarantee success. To increase the potential for success, we went to the learning analytics experts and asked how best to avoid failure. International Perspectives The annual Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conferences organized by the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are the most significant events for experts in this field. Since 2011, they have brought together educational leaders, practitioners, developers, and researchers from around the world to share their work and discuss what remains to be done. This year, the conference brought together 420 of the people best qualified to explain how to avoid failure in analytics. We began our exploration of the best ways to avoid failure with a one-day "Failathon" workshop.2 This provided an environment in which individuals could learn from each other's failures and pool their past experience and insights in order to develop recommendations for the field. The Failathon brought together experts from North and South America, Australasia, Asia, and Europe — providing an international perspective on the ways in which things can go wrong and how these problems can be avoided.},
