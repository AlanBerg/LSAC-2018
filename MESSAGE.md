## <span style="color:darkred">Message:</span> LSAC 2018 Hackathon

This is the message the event passes on to the next event.


[Event](https://lsac2018.org)

We addressed Four themes:

1. [Multimodal Exercise](https://github.com/dimstudio/multimodal-analyzer/blob/master/MultimodalHack_with_CPR.ipynb)
2. [Hacking the hackaton](https://github.com/AlanBerg/LSAC-2018/tree/master/Groups/HackingHackathon)
3. [Authentic Tasks from 10000 monsterboard advertisments](https://github.com/LAK-Hackathon/LAK18Hackathon/tree/master/groups/Eportfolio)
4. [A Risk Mitigation dashboard for Learning Analytics](https://github.com/AlanBerg/LSAC-2018/tree/master/Slides/RiskMitigationDashBoard)

### Multimodal

An experiment around neural networks to classify successful and unsuccessful CPR training events

### Hacking the hackathon

We concluded that we should provide more opportunities for student participation. There is an on-going debate around how to provide a motivating reward system.

### Authentic tasks

The review was merged with the SURF actvity around their next generation experimental National infrastructure

[Initial Presentation and Lessons learned](https://github.com/AlanBerg/LSAC-2018/tree/master/Slides/SURF)

1. *<span style="color:darkred">In the following hackathon consider looking at common design patterns across national infrastructures</span>*

### Risk Mitigation

The dashboard [took shape](https://github.com/AlanBerg/LSAC-2018/blob/master/Groups/RiskMitigation/ExampleMockup.html), however much work is required. Consider taking further:

1. Increasing the number and detail of the risks
2. Ranking the risks
3. Review inter ranker reliability
4. Generate a top ten list
5. Publish to a fixed URL
6. Look at Authority, ownership, and sponsorship.
7. Writing help material to define the process and howto edit the dashboard.
8. *<span style="color:darkred">Cleanup</span>* the initial version of the dashboard. Make workable
