##  LSAC-2018 Hackathon
***October 24-25 2018***

This [github location](https://github.com/AlanBerg/LSAC-2018) is the evidence hub for the [LSAC 2018 hackathon](http://lsac2018.org). A two day event for hacking anonymous Educational data and infrastructure for the benefit of the life long learner.

For information on a series of [interrelated hackathons](https://lakhackathon.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/lakhackathon2018_paper_2.pdf) please visit the [website](https://lakhackathon.wordpress.com/about/history/)

See the [Agenda](http://lsac2018.org/#hackathon)

The hackathon isnâ€™t a conventional academic workshop. New ideas are still encouraged and very welcome on the day. Please come ready to pitch your idea with a 15 minute (maximum) presentation.

One key difference to a normal workshop is that we expect to produce outputs during the workshop, as well as having inputs at the start of the hackathon. Hackathon attendees can get themselves added to the Participants Team to get write access. Drop Alan and Tom an email

## Structure of the Repository

We will follow the practice of previous  hackathons, taking care to organise and preserve the outputs from the hackathon in GitHub. This repository has been set up for the 2018 hackathon; this will include:

* Initial contributions of lightning talks or position papers, etc
* Either access arrangements for hackathon data, or the data itself
* Notes, diagrams, etc created by the working groups
* Code developed during the hackathon

Directories in Github and their meaning:

1. ***slides/*** - copies of slide decks used in the introductory part of the Hackathon.
2. ***technical_docs/*** - documentation etc for the technical infrastructure.
3. ***groups/*** - a place where each working group can deposit outputs of any kind, from photographs of flipcharts to working code.
