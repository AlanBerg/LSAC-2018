##  LSAC-2018 Hackathon
***October 24-25 2018***

This github location is the evidence hub for the [LSAC 2018 hackathon](http://lsac2018.org). A two day event for hacking anaonymous Educational data and infrastructure for the benefit of the life long learner.

For information on a series of [interrelated hackathons](https://lakhackathon.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/lakhackathon2018_paper_2.pdf) please visit the [website](https://lakhackathon.wordpress.com/about/history/)

## Structure

See the [Agenda](http://lsac2018.org/#hackathon)

The hackathon isnâ€™t a conventional academic workshop. New ideas are still encouraged and very welcome on the day. Please come ready to pitch your idea with a 15 minute (maximum) presentation.

One key difference to a normal workshop is that we expect to produce outputs during the workshop, as well as having inputs at the start of the hackathon.

We will follow the practice of previous  hackathons, taking care to organise and preserve the outputs from the hackathon in GitHub. This repository has been set up for the 2018 hackathon; this will include:

* Initial contributions of lightning talks or position papers, etc
* Either access arrangements for hackathon data, or the data itself
* Notes, diagrams, etc created by the working groups
* Code developed during the hackathon

Hackathon attendees can get themselves added to the Participants Team to get write access. Drop Alan and Tom an email
